<h2> Recipe By: Laura Job</h2>
   <p class="feature">About This Drink </p>
        <p> Sorrel drink is made from the petals of a species of Hibiscus, known as Hibiscus sabdariffa (Roselle). It can be used fresh, frozen, or dried, but it is mostly sold in dried form.</p>
	<p class="feature"> Sorrel Health Benefits</p>
	   <p>Sorrel has very high concentrations of fiber and vitamin C. It includes other nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin B6, iron, calcium, potassium, and magnesium. So, this drink while being tasty can have many health benefits, it all depends on how much sugar you add.</p>
	<p class="feature">Different Ways Sorrel Is Made</p>
		<p> Different islands give sorrel their own spin, varying the spices and other ingredients. Some people add ginger ale to the mix. Wine, rum or other alcohols can be used for the optional buzzy kick. Some people let the sorrel sit for 1-3 days before drinking it. However, my family drinks it the same day made. </p>

<h3>why this is my favorite recipe!!!</h3>

<p> My family is from Trinidad and Tobago, so I was introduced to this drink as a little girl as a tradition. We usually drink it only on special occasions such as Christmas and birthdays. This is my favorite recipe because of how simple it is to make yet how flavorful it is. It's sweet, bitter, tangy and has a hint of spice all at once. I love that I can taste all the flavors separately, all the ingredients complement each other so well. I get excited when I get to share this amazing drink on special occasions with my friends. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! <br> <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/" target="_blank"> Click To Find Your Own Favorite Recipe</a></p>
